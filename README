= ontopia-tldr - Tolog Document Retrieval with Ontopia

== VERSION

This documentation refers to ontopia-tldr version 0.0.2


== DESCRIPTION

Ontopia::TLDR is an attempt at bridging the gap between the worlds of formal
knowledge representation (ontologies, topic maps, etc.) and bibliographic document
retrieval (bibliographic databases). It allows for retrieving documents from
bibliographic databases (currently, only Midos[http://progris.de] databases are
supported) by means of tolog[http://ontopia.net/omnigator/docs/query/tutorial.html],
Ontopia's[http://ontopia.net] topic map query language.

=== Deployment

Ontopia::TLDR comes as a Sinatra application, so all the standard deployment
options apply (rackup, Passenger[https://www.phusionpassenger.com/], etc.).
However, in order to allow for maximum flexibility, you need to supply your
own <tt>config.ru</tt> file; e.g. (see Ontopia::TLDR for available options):

  require 'ontopia/tldr'

  Ontopia::TLDR.set(
    dbm_file: File.expand_path('../tldr.dbm', __FILE__),
    xtm_file: File.expand_path('../tldr.xtm', __FILE__),

    document_keys: %w[YOUR DOCUMENT KEYS],
    topic_keys:    %w[YOUR TOPIC KEYS],

    title: 'YOUR TITLE'
  )

  run Ontopia::TLDR

Assuming the following directory layout:

  /srv/tldr
    |
    +-- config.ru
    |
    +-- tldr.dbm
    |
    +-- tldr.xtm
    |
    +-- tmp/

Place your database and topic map files there and adjust their paths in the
<tt>config.ru</tt> file. The <tt>tmp/</tt> directory is used by Passenger
for the <tt>restart.txt</tt> file.

To deploy Ontopia::TLDR with Passenger on Apache, create a symlink in the
DocumentRoot pointing to the app's <tt>public/</tt> directory (this example
makes use of current_gem[http://blackwinter.github.com/current_gem]; adjust
the paths according to your environment):

  /var/www
    |
    +-- tldr -> /usr/local/jruby/lib/ruby/gems/shared/current/ontopia-tldr/lib/ontopia/tldr/public

Then put the following snippet in Apache's VirtualHost configuration:

  <VirtualHost *:80>
    ...

    RackBaseURI /tldr
    <Directory /var/www/tldr>
      Options -MultiViews
      PassengerAppRoot /srv/tldr                # <-- This (non-standard) line is important
      PassengerRuby /usr/local/jruby/bin/jruby  # <-- And this one sets the Ruby interpreter to JRuby
    </Directory>
  </VirtualHost>


== SUPPORTED PLATFORMS

Ontopia::TLDR requires JRuby[http://jruby.org]. It has been tested with jruby
1.7.4 (1.9.3p392) on OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM 1.6.0_27-b27 [linux-amd64].
